us you pixel-name & choose difficulty level (we made three of those, since we don't \
wanna be too boring). Then, it will be nice to click 'Play' button and start \
tapping the boxes to match all of them with the same color! Oh, I almost forgot. \
There's a button with misterious +, so what about this one? Well, you need to match all \
other boxes colors accordingly to this button. Make sense, huh? By the way, ENJOY!"
